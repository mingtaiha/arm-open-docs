To setup Heroku:

In `runtime.txt`, needed to change `python-3.5.1` to `python-3.6.1`
because Heroku only Python Buildpacks 2.7.13 and 3.6.1

In order to deploy app on Heroku:

) Install basic Heroku CLI (Depends on your OS)
2) Login to Heroku CLI `heroku login`
3) Clone a repository (or make one)
4) Create a git remote (`heroku`) with `heroku create 
5) Make a commit, then push to heroku (`git push heroku master`)

Once the repo is pushed to Heroku, the app is deployed,
1) Get an instance of the app running `heroku ps:scale web=1`
2) Run `heroku open` to go to website with CLI, or visit the website
    received from 1)

To check the logs of getting the app running, run `heroku logs --tail`
(Ctrl-C to quit)

This is a way to check for errors

If the app uses environment variables (which server.py does),
Set the env variables (Heroku calls config vars)
`heroku config:set <VAR_NAME>=<VAR_VALUE>`
